This is M Satvik Reddy. I am doing app/ android development internship from codtech. My offer letter has been posted in linkedin. My intern ID is CT6WDS2058.
My internship span is 6 WEEKS from SEPTEMBER 30th, 2024 to NOVEMBER 15th, 2024. I learnt app development in java language. And the code which has been done is a
TO-DO-LIST app. It allows us to choose from option 1,2,3,4. Which are Adding a task what we want to do if option 1 is selected, Marks a task as completed if this 
is not given it shows as "incomplete" this happens when option 2 is selected, Deletes the task if the option 3 is selected, views all the tasks which all are avialable 
as a list with completed and incomplete details if option 4 is selected, and exits from the application if the option 5 is selected.This app demonstrates basic list 
management, user input handling, and object-oriented principles in Java. Itâ€™s perfect for learning Java fundamentals in building simple, interactive applications. 
The Task class represents each individual task, storing the task's description (name) and its completion status (isComplete). The class includes methods for marking a 
task as complete and for displaying the task status. The ToDoListApp class contains the main application logic, handling user inputs and managing a list of Task objects. 
This class provides methods to add, delete, mark complete, and display tasks. User Interaction: The app uses a Scanner to read user input, allowing interaction via a simple
menu displayed on the console. This menu includes options to add, complete, delete, view tasks, and exit. Error Handling: The app checks for invalid inputs, such as 
selecting a task number outside the list range, and gives feedback when an invalid choice is made. Looped Menu: The main menu operates in a loop, letting users perform 
multiple actions in one session until they choose to exit. When the app is started, it presents a menu to the user. The user chooses an option by entering a number (1 to 5)
to perform tasks like adding, marking complete, deleting, or viewing all tasks. The app responds by executing the desired action, updating the list accordingly. The app
will continue to display the menu after each action, enabling the user to manage tasks as needed. The program only exits when the user selects "Exit." This project is a 
great exercise in basic Java concepts, such as: Object-Oriented Programming: The Task class encapsulates data and behavior related to a to-do item. Collections: The 
ArrayList stores tasks dynamically, allowing for easy task management. User Input: It handles user inputs with Scanner, allowing for interactive functionality. Control 
Structures: It uses a while loop for the menu, and switch-case for action selection. The output I got is done in visual studio java.
